A repo to play with github workspace and rust

## Getting Started with Rust

To get started with Rust, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust: You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. Verify Installation: After installation, you can verify that Rust is installed correctly by running `rustc --version` in your terminal. You should see `rustc 1.82.0` or a similar version number.
3. Create a New Project: You can create a new Rust project by running `cargo new my_project` in your terminal. This will create a new directory with the necessary files for a Rust project.
4. Build and Run: Navigate to your project directory and run `cargo build` to build your project. You can then run your project with `cargo run`.

Happy coding with Rust!
